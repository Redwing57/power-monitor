// This is a repository for development of an arduino-based project to build a DC power monitor.  
// The hardware includes an Adafruit Metro, an LCD shield, and a data loggin shield.
// An external 30A current sensor will be added.
// The project will measure DC current and power and calculate instantaneous power
// at a short interval and store the info on the data logger.
